  "bio": "My name is Franco N. Colaizzi and I am a strategic technical leader & system architect with over a decade of experience driving large-scale Android and web initiatives. A former educator turned technical director, I leverage a unique background in mathematics and instruction to translate complex, multi-layered technical flows into accessible, executive-ready narratives for broad organizational alignment. I specialize in building resilient, future-proof architectures by defaulting to time-tested, industry-standard solutions that prioritize stability and maintainability over fleeting trends. Known for a high-empathy approach to leadership, I focus on mentoring cross-functional teams, fostering professional growth, and bridging the communication gap between business vision and technical execution.",
