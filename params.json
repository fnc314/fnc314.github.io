I hold a Bachelor's Degree in pure Mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh where I graduated Cum Laude.  In January 2014 I enrolled in a 3 month immersive program (Web Development Immersive) offered by General Assembly.  Through this course I mastered Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, API integration, and the M-V-C Framework.  Outside of my time at General Assembly, I've become comfortable with both Python and Java, teaching myself how to work with the Android platform.\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\nThrough-out the Web Development Immersive, I've worked both individually and in groups.  I learned that I work best in groups and prefer to be an active team player on any project.  There were two grand projects during the 12 week immersive class:\r\n\r\n- The First Project: [HairEtcApp](https://github.com/fnc314/Project1).  This project was designed to be a small web-based app for a family business (a hair salon) in the Pittsburgh area.  The app is a simple portal through which clients can schedule appointments with their desired stylist at Hair Etc.  The app implements Twilio to send a chosen stylist a text message containing information about the newly created appointment.  The customer can also view their entire appointment history.\r\n![See: http://afternoon-meadow-8655.herokuapp.com/](http://i.imgur.com/dPxI1WH.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- The Second Project: [Seat](https://github.com/jacksonsandland/seat).  This app was a group project with [Darren Wong](https://github.com/darrenwong916) and [Jackson Sandland](https://github.com/jacksonsandland).  Seat is a web app for a given restaurant (ours was Alexander's Steak House).  Seat contains a customer facing portal through which they make accounts (either by their own email address or through Facebook account association).  Once users are registered, they can create reservations and view past reservations.  Users receive a confirmation email to verify the creation of their account and the creation of a new reservation (powered by ActiveMailer in Rails).  Customers receive a reminder text (generated using Twilio) 24 hours before a reservation.  The other half of the web app is an administration view for the restaurant managers and staff.  This portal (created using the ActiveAdmin gem) gives administrators the ability to create/delete reservations, assign reservations to tables, set servers (creating and deleting them as well - to coincide with hiring and firing of wait-staff), and update tables (as well as place reservations at specific tables).  This app can be accessed as an administrator using `fnc314@gmail.com` (email) and `0123456789` (password).  To access the services as a normal customer, simply create an account!\r\n![See http://stark-caverns-5761.herokuapp.com/](http://i.imgur.com/V7x0Pyg.png)\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n|||\r\n|:-:|:-:|\r\n|Languages|Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java|\r\n|Frameworks|Rails, Angular.js, Backbone.js|\r\n|Databases|Postgres, MySQL|\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra-Curricular Activities\r\nDuring the program I took the initiative to teach myself the valuable languages of Python and Java.  I have been recently experimenting with the Android SDK.  I developed a working app called [Mathify](https://www.github.com/fnc314/Mathify) for the sole purpose of experimenting with Android.  I hope to work more with Java and Python, I prefer them over Ruby.\r\n\r\nI also like to volunteer my time helping other people understand and better utilize technology.  Just recently, I completed a full guide for Non-Profits in the city of Pittsburgh, PA to migrate to Google Apps for Business.  The Guide is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2uBBglaYCYQNjVGQkVzOEJUS1k/edit?usp=sharing).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
